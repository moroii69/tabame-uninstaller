## alternative method

if you have concerns about running the executable or prefer a more hands-on approach, you can run the python script directly. the script replicates the functionality of the executable, offering flexibility and transparency in the uninstallation process.

[download uninstaller.py](https://github.com/moroii69/uninstaller/blob/main/uninstaller.py)

## note

both the `.exe` and `.py` methods perform the same task: they execute a series of steps to completely uninstall tabame from your system. the `.exe` is essentially a compiled version of the python script, providing an easier, more convenient way to perform the same uninstallation process.
